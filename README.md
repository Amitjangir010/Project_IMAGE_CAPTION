# Project Image Captioning

## Overview
This project is designed to create descriptive captions for images, merging the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. Using a dataset of images paired with descriptive captions, the project trains a model to generate captions for new, unseen images.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: (list libraries here, e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, etc.)

## Dataset
The dataset comprises images along with their corresponding captions. The captions are used to train the model to understand and describe the content of images.

## Training the Model
The includes steps for loading and preprocessing , then by the training of a model capable of generating captions for images. 

- **Load and Preprocess the Data**: Captions and image names are loaded and preprocessed to format suitable for model training.
- **Model Training**: The training process involves fitting the model on the training dataset to learn the correlation between images and their captions.

## Evaluation
After training, the model's performance is evaluated on a validation set to ensure it generates accurate and relevant captions for new images.
