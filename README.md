# 🖼️ AI Image Caption Generator

An intelligent deep learning system that automatically generates natural language descriptions for images using LSTM networks and transfer learning.

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project combines computer vision and natural language processing to:
- Extract visual features from images using InceptionV3
- Generate human-like descriptions using LSTM networks
- Bridge the gap between visual and textual information
- Create accessible image descriptions

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Vision Encoder
- InceptionV3 for feature extraction
- Pre-trained on ImageNet
- 2048-dimensional image embeddings

### Language Decoder
- LSTM network for sequence generation
- Word embeddings using GloVe
- Attention mechanism for focus
- Beam search for caption generation

## 💻 Implementation Details

### Data Processing
- Image preprocessing and normalization
- Caption cleaning and tokenization
- Vocabulary building
- Sequence padding

### Model Components
```python
# Feature Extractor
inputs1 = Input(shape=(2048,))
fe1 = Dropout(0.5)(inputs1)
fe2 = Dense(256, activation='relu')(fe1)

# Sequence Model
inputs2 = Input(shape=(max_length,))
se1 = Embedding(vocab_size, 256, mask_zero=True)(inputs2)
se2 = Dropout(0.5)(se1)
se3 = LSTM(256)(se2)
```
